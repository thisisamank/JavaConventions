### Naming Conventions
- **Classes and Interfaces**: Use PascalCase, starting with uppercase, e.g., `MyClass`.
- **Methods and Variables**: Use camelCase, starting with lowercase, e.g., `myVariable`.
- **Constants**: Use all uppercase with underscores, e.g., `MY_CONSTANT`.
- **Packages**: Use lowercase, avoiding underscores if possible, e.g., `mypackage`.

### Coding Style
- **Braces**: Use the "K&R style" for braces, where opening braces are at the end of the line and closing braces start on a new line aligned with the start of the line that opened them.
- **Indentation**: Use spaces (commonly 4) instead of tabs for indentation.
- **One Statement per Line**: Avoid multiple statements on a single line.
- **Line Length**: Keep lines to 80-100 characters long, if possible, for readability.
- **Spacing and Blank Lines**: Use spaces around operators and after commas for clarity. Use blank lines to separate logical blocks of code.

### Commenting and Documentation
- **Use Javadoc Standard Comments** for classes, interfaces, methods, and fields.
- **Inline Comments**: Use them sparingly to explain "why" not "what".
- **TODO Comments**: Mark sections of the code that need enhancements or fixes with `// TODO:` comments.

### Class and Interface Design
- **Visibility**: Use the least visibility necessary for classes, methods, and members.
- **Final Classes and Methods**: Use `final` on methods and classes that are not designed for extension or overriding.
- **Static Methods**: Prefer static methods if no access to instance fields is required.
- **Immutable Objects**: Strive for immutability in classes wherever practical.

### Method Design
- **Parameter Passing**: Prefer passing interfaces or supertypes instead of concrete classes.
- **Return Types**: Prefer returning interfaces or supertypes for flexibility.
- **Overloading With Caution**: Only overload methods for significantly different behaviors.

### Error Handling
- **Exceptions**: Prefer unchecked (runtime) exceptions unless you expect the caller to recover.
- **Catch Blocks**: Handle exceptions as close to the source as possible, providing meaningful responses or logging.

### Generics
- **Usage**: Use generics for type safety and to avoid casts.
- **Naming Conventions**: Use single uppercase letters for generic type parameters, e.g., `E` for element, `K` for key, `V` for value.

### Enums
- **Usage**: Prefer enums over constants for fixed sets of constants, such as days of the week.
- **Implementing Interfaces**: Use enums to implement interfaces for added utility and flexibility.

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Separate code into different classes and methods based on functionality.
- **Use of Packages**: Organize classes into packages that represent different layers or features of your application.

### Testing Conventions
- **Unit Testing**: Follow naming conventions for tests, usually reflecting the method name with a `Test` suffix, e.g., `methodNameTest`.
- **Assertive Testing**: Use assertive language in test case names, like `shouldReturnXYZWhenABC`.

### Version Control Best Practices
- **Commit Messages**: Use informative and concise commit messages that describe changes clearly.
- **Branching Strategy**: Adopt a consistent branching strategy like GitFlow or feature branching.
